# Shader Stuff
 
## Rain (Done)
Rain that melts you down. There's a red variation that melts you down instantly, rather than if you stop moving that will go a little later in the game.
 
## Solid Blocks (Done)
Useful for some sort of puzzle and platforming section. Also useful for hidden blocks of some sort. Definitely have some sort of idea on how I might make a level out of this.

## Transportation (Done)
A wall that collapses and goes in on itself. The most dreamlike of the effects, I might have it start by doing only half a screen to make it look like you've gone on the ceiling and use some collision changes or something to keep that effect?

## Hidden Chambers (Mostly Done)
Parts of the level that stretch and depress from the view of the player. If you're in one of these rooms, you either go to a void or you see a fade in for another part of the level? Either that, or the player could enter these areas as a form of fast travel?

## Walls that close and open up to something different (Not Started)
A different version of the hidden chambers, perhaps?

## Rooms that act different when illuminated in different light (Not Started) (MAIN MECHANIC: Next on TODO)
This could be an interesting set of rooms to explore.

## Reset Rooms (Not Started)
A button that you push to reset the state of the room (except for your position). Could make it so we could make some interesting non-euclidean puzzles without horribly soft locking the player.

## Visual Shader Effects (Not Started)
So stuff like the sine wave effect could show up a little later in the game or something. (Maybe caused by some sort of emitter?)

## Doors that you can only enter when they're formed. (Not Started)
Doors that are normally not there but can be entered if the light is shined just right or everything aligns to create a door. Could help with the dream logic of this all. (Need to add some sort of texture first or something.)

## Cut Screen (Not Started)
A screen that's cut into four parts, but which is seamless to get in and out of. Shouldn't be too hard to do? Could be more dream-like by forcing a player split during a later part of the game.

## Anti-Chamber Portals (Not Started)
Of course, to make it non-euclidean, we should have seamless portals. This could also be used to do different variations of each room to make slight alterations anytime someone visits that room?
